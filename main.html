	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p><b>Time complexity is a critical concept in computer science that measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It is essential for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms, as it helps determine how quickly a program can run and how it scales with larger inputs. An efficient algorithm with optimal time complexity can significantly enhance performance, especially for large datasets, making it a cornerstone in the design and analysis of algorithms. efficient</b></p>
	<p>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of the input data. It is a vital factor in assessing an algorithm's efficiency, alongside time complexity. Space complexity is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. An algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses memory linearly proportional to the input size, indicating that as the input grows, the memory usage grows at the same rate. Understanding space complexity is crucial for optimizing memory usage and ensuring that algorithms run efficiently within the available system resources.</p>
